must fix dates on the other ones i dont have internet so i cant right now nightmare nightmare nightmare
make sure text scales appropriately. try setting zoom to literally anything but 100% and you see what I mean
see about moving the header to the middle not left. i want it to be more noticable bc the image takes up too much attention
implement color scheme from before ^^L2-6
the image shadow overlaps the date text and it is a little annoying also idk how I like it being aligned to a filet/rounded edge
scroll bar thing does NOT work

                    I began my electronics career by building a EMP gun after watching a YouTube video about it. The device works by exploiting a fundamental property of physics called induction.
                    As an electron moves (electrical current), it makes a magenetic field, and the same logic applies in the opposite: as a magnetic field changes, it&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">induces</span>
                    a current in a nearby conductor.<br>
                    By using a bug zapper and a spark gap to create fast pulses, my EMP gun generates a rapidly changing magnetic field.
                    This field can induce currents in nearby electronics, which can fry them.

                    The final product looks messy, but I wanted to give it a 'DIY' feel. It works by using a battery (thin blue box on the bottom front) to power the circuit from a bug zapper (main circuit board),
                    which has a small spark gap connected to an air inductor (wire coil).<br>
                    I took some measurements on my oscilioscope, and saw a minimum of -1.04 volts which is enough to destroy some components due to the unprotected reverse polarity.

                    In my house, I am forced to walk to every light switch in order to toggle it. For my second electrical project I decided to design a remote controlled switch that could act as a hand pressing something.
                    In order to plan for this project, I was forced to learn about schematics and to memorize the symbols for each component. I put what I had learned to the test with this project by drawing my first schematic.
                    While it was very simple, and there are a thousand different things that I would do now differently, it actually worked.

                    I had no concept of infrared sensors or subGHz communications, so I stripped apart a remote controlled light and detected if it was on with a photosensitive diode.
                    I then used an arduino to control a small servo motor which could press something it was taped to. 
                    I also made an attempt to block external frequencies with a polarized 100 microfarad capacitor (which didn't really do anything).<br>
                    Even with all of its flaws, I still believe this smart switch project was a turning point where I used my limited knowledge to solve problems in creative ways.

                    To put my coding and electronics skills to the test, I decided to build a website that could trigger a shocking device from anywhere in the world.
                    I used a Raspberry Pi to host the webserver, and to interface with the shocking device. Later, I replaced the LED seen in the photo with a servo motor that would press the button to trigger the shock device.
                    I tested the website with my friend in California, and he was able to trigger different things with a latency of less than 400ms.
