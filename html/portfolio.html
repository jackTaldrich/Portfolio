                    After watching a YouTube video about it, I began my electronics career by building an EMP gun. The device works by exploiting a fundamental property of physics called induction.
                    As an electron moves (electrical current), it makes a magnetic field, and the same logic applies to the opposite: as a magnetic field changes, it induces a current in a nearby conductor.
                    My EMP gun generates a rapidly changing magnetic field using a bug zapper and a spark gap to create fast pulses. This field can induce currents in nearby electronics, which can fry them.

                    The final product looks messy, but I wanted to give it a 'DIY' feel. It works by using a battery (thin blue box on the bottom front) to power the circuit from a bug zapper (main circuit board),
                    which has a small spark gap connected to an air inductor (wire coil). I took measurements on my oscilloscope and saw a minimum of -1.04 volts, which is enough to destroy some components due to the unprotected reverse polarity.

                    I have to walk to every light switch in my house to toggle it. For my second electrical project, I decided to design a remote-controlled switch that could act as a hand pressing something.
                    I had to learn about schematics and memorize each component's symbols to plan for this project. I put what I had learned to the test with this project by drawing my first schematic.
                    While it was straightforward, and there are a thousand different things that I would do differently now, it worked.

                    I had no concept of infrared sensors or subGHz communications, so I stripped apart a remote-controlled light and detected if it was on with a photosensitive diode.
                    I then used an Arduino to control a small servo motor that could press something I taped it to. I also attempted to block external frequencies with a polarized 100 microfarad capacitor (which didn't really do anything).
                    Despite its flaws, my smart switch project was a turning point in my career. It allowed me to use my limited knowledge to solve problems creatively.

                    To put my coding and electronics skills to the test, I decided to build a website that could trigger a shocking device from anywhere in the world.
                    I used a Raspberry Pi to host the webserver and interface with the shocking device. Later, I replaced the LED seen in the photo with a servo motor that would press the button to trigger the shock device.
                    I tested the website with my friend in California, and he was able to trigger different things with a latency of less than 400ms.

                    Near the end of my Sophomore year, I bought a CNC machine, and it arrived at the start of my summer break. I spent most of my summer learning how to use it and interacting with the community.
                    I made some interesting pieces and art with it, but I felt I could use it in a business. I started a small business where I would create customized wood pieces for people in my neighborhood.
                    I sold cutting boards, coasters, and detailed image frames, all that could have custom images/text burned into them with a laser. I made a decent amount of money, and the business was a service to the community,
                    as many people had many ideas but without access to cheap manufacturing. I also used my CNC machine to fabricate various engineering parts from plastic, carbon fiber, aluminum, and other soft metals.

                    One of my most enormous hurdles was learning how to design a printed circuit board (PCB). All my attempts to make one came out poorly, as I was (and still am) inexperienced.
                    After finding a YouTube channel covering complex PCB design, I followed a few tutorials and made this board with an STM32 chip.

                    The end product is a simple but polished board that can read live information from sources such as a 3-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, and a digital motion processor, which can be vital in a drone.

                    Cold plasma occurs when a nonreactive noble gas like helium flows through plasma and does not allow plasma to reach extreme temperatures.
                    I saw a video about the subject and thought buying some parts and building a device that could make cold plasma would be fun.

                    I bought a ~10kV 10kHz arc generator online and 3D-printed a nozzle to attach it to so that helium could flow through it.
                    The plasma from the device I bought likely has a temperature ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 Kelvin, but after I had my dad pump helium into the nozzle, it would not burn me.

                    After learning about schematic and PCB design, I decided to make a board based on an idea I had. At the end of my Junior year,
                    I started playing guitar consistently every day for at least an hour. After a little while of playing, I learned how essential different effects are in crafting a unique tone.

                    A common way that people make a different tone is by using guitar pedals to add distortion, enhance specific frequencies, etc. Since the frontman of an enormous band lives not too far from me,
                    and I have some connections with people who know him, it would be a fun engineering challenge to design, fabricate, and assemble a unique guitar pedal for him.
